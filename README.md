Stock analysis for Steve
# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project:

The project was based around Steve evaluation of the stock DAQO for his parents.  They were interested in buying the stock because they met at DQ.  From our analysis the stock did not perform well so we helped Steve analyze the entire stock portfolio. 

## Results:

The first screen shot will show the For Loop code to extract data on DAQO or DQ’s performance.  The code stated that we searched for column A from the first row to the very last row of the column.  We then came back up and found the last row with data.  Once we found the data we searched for stock DQ.  Once it was found we found the starting and ending price to find our return.  Which you will see in the 2nd image.  And it shows DQ’s performance was a negative 62.6%

Advantages and disadvantages of original and refactored VBA Script.
The advantage of using an original VBA script is that you are done.  You don’t have to test it.  The disadvantage is that it could have been written more concise or efficient.  That is the advantage to refactoring VBA script.  When you go back thru the code you can clean it up to make understanding the code easier for the end user.
