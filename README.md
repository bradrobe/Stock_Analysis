Stock analysis for Steve
# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project:

The project was based around Steve evaluation of the stock DAQO for his parents.  They were interested in buying the stock because they met at DQ.  From our analysis the stock did not perform well so we helped Steve analyze the entire stock portfolio. 

## Results:

The first two screens below display the codes used to compare the the tickerIndex.  The code stated that we searched for column A from the first row to the very last row of the column.  We then came back up and found the last row with data.  Once we found the data we searched for stock DQ.  Once it was found we found the starting and ending price to find our return.
The second two screens display the results of the refactoring and the time new runtimes.

## Summary:

Refactoring coding in general has advantages and disadvantages.  The advantage to refactoring a code is that it can make it a better code, more efficient.  
The disadvantage is that you may have to retest the code to make certain the refactored code runs and runs efficiently.

There are a few advantges refactoring has over the original script.  It enables you to maintain the code while making suttle changes to making it more effiecient with better or less code.  This results in a cleaner and easier code to read and understand.
Refactoring doesn't come with out it's disadvantages.  If you code is big then you have the chance for more errors that you will have to fix to make sure code correctly runs.  It can be a real problem if the developer refactoring the original script doesn't understand the code from the base meaning.  The developer refactoring the script could deminish the orginal idea or reason for the original script.
